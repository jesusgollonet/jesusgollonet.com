            p(class="lh-copy f7") Hey! I'm Jesús Gollonet. I am the Tech Director at Resn Amsterdam. My work involves architecting our experiences, implementing and managing backend systems, being the main point of contact for technical communication with clients and vendors, and improving and, um, operating operations.
            p(class="lh-copy f7") I'm interested in many things. Today I'm mostly wondering about what #[strong(class="blue") serverless] / #[strong(class="blue") infrastructure as code] can offer a creative production agency, how #[strong(class="blue") event sourcing and functional techniques] can help us architect more solid experiences, and if / how #[strong(class="blue") decentralized tech] will change the web.
            p(class="lh-copy f7") In a previous life I was a creative coder building web experiences, interactive audio toys, mobile apps, interactive installations. 
            p(class="lh-copy f7") I work remotely from Málaga in the south of Spain. I write less code than I'd like to, mostly javascript / node.js these days. I live in iterm, zsh, tmux, vim.
